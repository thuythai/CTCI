<h5>Why is the amortized insertion runtime 0(7)?</h5>

Suppose you have an array of size N. We can work backwards to compute how many elements we copied
at each capacity increase. Observe that when we increase the array to K elements, the array was previously
halfthat size. Therefore, we needed to copy Yz elements.
final capacity increase
previous capacity increase:
previous capacity increase :
previous capacity increase:

n/2 elements to copy
n/4 elements to copy
n/B elements to copy
n/16 elements to copy
second capacity increase 2 elements to copy
first capacity increase 1 element to copy
Therefore, the total number of copies to insert N elements is roughly ~ + X + % + .. • + 2 +
1, which is just less than N.
<p><em>If the sum of this series isn't obvious to you, imagine this: Suppose you have a kilometer-long
walk to the store. You walk 0.5 kilometers, and then 0.25 kilometers, and then 0.125 kilometers,
and so on. You will never exceed one kilometer (although you'll get very close to it).
Therefore, inserting N elements takes O(N) work total. Each insertion is 0(1) on average, even though
some insertions take 0 (N) time in the worst case.<strong>(89)</strong></em></p>

<h5>StringBuilder</h5>
<p>On each concatenation, a new copy of the string is created, and the two strings are copied over, character
by character. The first iteration requires us to copy x characters. The second iteration requires copying 2x
characters. The third iteration requires 3x, and so on. The total time therefore is 0 (x + 2x + .•• + nx).
This reduces to 0 (xn2).
I Why is itO(xn2)? Because 1 + 2 + ••• + n equals n(n+1)/2, orO(n2).
StringBuilder can help you avoid this problem. StringBuilder simply creates a resizable array of all
the strings, copying them back to a string only when necessary.<strong>(90)</strong></p>

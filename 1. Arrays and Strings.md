###### Please note that array questions and string questions are often interchangeable. That is, a question that this
###### book states using an array may be asked instead as a string question, and vice versa.

## Why is the amortized insertion runtime 0(1)?

Suppose you have an array of size N. We can work backwards to compute how many elements we copied
at each capacity increase. Observe that when we increase the array to K elements, the array was previously
halfthat size. Therefore, we needed to copy Yz elements.
final capacity increase: 
previous capacity increase:n/2 elements to copy
previous capacity increase :n/4 elements to copy
previous capacity increase:n/8 elements to copy

Therefore, the total number of copies to insert N elements is roughly ~ + X + % + .. • + 2 +
1, which is just less than N. 

If the sum of this series isn't obvious to you, imagine this: Suppose you have a kilometer-long
walk to the store. You walk 0.5 kilometers, and then 0.25 kilometers, and then 0.125 kilometers,
and so on. You will never exceed one kilometer (although you'll get very close to it).
Therefore, inserting N elements takes O(N) work total. Each insertion is 0(1) on average, even though
some insertions take 0 (N) time in the worst case.(89)

## StringBuilder
On each concatenation, a new copy of the string is created, and the two strings are copied over, character
by character. The first iteration requires us to copy x characters. The second iteration requires copying 2x
characters. The third iteration requires 3x, and so on. The total time therefore is 0 (x + 2x + .•• + nx).
This reduces to 0 (xn2).

Why is itO(xn2)? Because 1 + 2 + ••• + n equals n(n+1)/2, orO(n2).
StringBuilder can help you avoid this problem. StringBuilder simply creates a resizable array of all
the strings, copying them back to a string only when necessary.(90)

## Interview Questions
**Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures?**
Hints: #44, # 777, # 7 32
*Hash Table for O(n), sorting for O(nlogn)</p>*

**Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.**
Hints: #7, #84, #722, #737
*Hash Table for O(n), sorting for O(nlogn)</p>*

**URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)**
EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr John Smith "J 13
Output: "Mr%20J ohn%20Smith"
*Hints: #53, #7 #78*
*Notes are bad. Best answer below*

```python
def urlify(in_string, in_string_length):
    return ''.join('%20' if c == ' ' else c for c in in_string[:in_string_length])
```

**Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palin-
drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.**

EXAMPLE

Input: Tact Coa

Output: True (permutations: "taco cat". "atco cta". etc.)

Hints: #106, #121, #134, #136

**Can you reduce the space usage by using a *bit vector?* **

**One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.**  \*

EXAMPLE

pale, pIe -> true

pales. pale -> true

pale. bale -> true

pale. bake -> false

Hints: #23, #97, #130
